        <p><em>In a quiet, sunbathed corner of one of the many courts, you find an old greenhouse. A teal platina has covered all of the exposed copper, and the glass has become cloudy from age.</em></p>
        <p><em>Walking inside, it seems oddly larger than it's exterior would allow; Plants are stacked row after row, interlaced with water works, careful arrangements of lamps and decorative stones.</em></p>

        <p>Hi! whether you've scrolled to this post from far up, or looked here very early on, you've reached the very beginning.</p>
        <p>I think I'll mostly just update this page with random stuff I'm working on! Like this website for example lol</p>
        <p>I'll make a bigger post with full behind the scenes of this project when I'm closer to completion, but this has taken a lot of hours so far!!</p>
