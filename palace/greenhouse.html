        <h2>The website launch</h2>
        <p>Hello!! So this is the day; I've started this project roughly around the 1st of February, which would mean it took me about 17 days.</p>
        <p>Which, honestly, is not at all bad - I mean, I did not know any HTML or CSS before this.</p>
        
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>I've wanted to join the indie web for a long time. Centralised social media has let us create and connect faster than ever, but it did so at the cost of handing over our expression to corporations. It's not even controversial to state that social media makes our lives worse - it's just an accepted fact.</p>
        <p>But, in the case of the web... We <em>can</em> just return to how things were. I think this is what pulls me so.</p>
        
        <h3>How?</h3>
        <p>If you're the kind of person to do this, you already know it. But this depends on how you want to do this:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Without programming:</strong>
            <p>You can use tools like <a href="https://sites.google.com">Google Sites</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.com/free/">WordPress</a> to make something with absolutely no code.</p>
            <p>Personally, though, I think you should go with <a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a>, and use one of the hundreds of templates other people offer for free.</p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>From scratch:</strong>
            <p>Firstly, you'll need to learn how to do HTML/CSS. I recommend starting with the <a href="https://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/">HTML Dog</a> course - It's really easy to follow. After you complete this, do their CSS beginner course, and if you feel up to it - the intermediate ones. This is more than enough to start.</p>
            <p>Next, you need a host - for this, I recommend <a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a> again; It's very simple. If you have some know-how, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">Github Pages</a> is a great alternative.</p>
            <p>And that's it! Now that you have the tools, the web is your canvas.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>One last thing: If you choose to do this, and need <strong>any</strong> help, please ask me. I will help you. For free. I'm not an expert either, but I've clearly managed; We can figure it out together!</p>
        
        <h3>Thank you</h3>
        <p>For stopping by! Feel free to explore the rest of the palace, as I call it; I've archived actual years of my art here.</p>
        <p>Cheers!</p>

        <h2>The first post</h2>
        <p>Hi! whether you've scrolled to this post from far up, or looked here very early on, you've reached the very beginning.</p>
        <p>I think I'll mostly just update this page with random stuff I'm working on! Like this website for example lol</p>
        <p>I'll make a bigger post with full behind the scenes of this project when I'm closer to completion, but this has taken a lot of hours so far!!</p>
