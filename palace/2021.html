          <p>In this tower of the mind palace, you will find a gallery of my 'finished' SFW work. This includes original pieces, selected doodles, studies and fanart! I've done my best to omit studies of real people. Click on any piece to see it in full.</p>
          <p>Visit the Southern Tower to see the latest posts with more detail.</p>

          <p>I've started making art sometime in the summer of 2021, starting simply with a pen on paper. My first piece of digital art has been created on the evening of August 18th, 2021. These are my roots!</p>
